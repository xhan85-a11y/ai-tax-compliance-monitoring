# Methodology

1. **Schemas** define mandatory fields and types per jurisdiction.
2. **Rules** are evaluated deterministically (YAML-configured) and produce findings.
3. **Model** predicts non-compliance probability; combined with rules for final risk.
4. **Outputs**: audit trail, validation report, and export payload.
